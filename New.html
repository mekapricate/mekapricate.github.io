            <p>Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you.
              They're either lonely, they're missing somebody,
              They're depressed, they're hurt, they're scarred from the past, they're having personal issues no one
              knows about,
              They have secrets you wouldn't believe. They wish, they
              Dream and they hope.
              And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I'm writing this for you
              So you dont feel alone anymore. Always remember, don't be depressed about the past,
              Don't worry about the future, and just focus on today.
              If today's not so great don't worry! Tomorrow's a new chance.
              Have a nice day! :)</p>

            <p>So basically I had a crush on this girl which I wont tell, I was madly in love since she got all that I
              was looking for a girl, but sadly when I confessed she already had a boy friend. I was frustrated now
              knowing to do. All of that feeling were gone, snapped out of existance, it was a sad day, I can't even eat
              or do anything. I still talk to her at somepoint but its just not the same. Recently my crush of mine got
              *married* in minecraft?? Its kinda like when you give your girlfriend a nice present, not a real wedding
              by the way, so yeah, she invited me, when I saw the message, my soul crushed know I don't have a chance
              anymore but to move on... But what would A good guy would do is accept the invite wholeheartedly, I don't
              even want to go because I can't stand it, but just to support them, I just accepted it... There they where
              quote on quote marrying, luckily my mom told me to go To dinner, so I havent watch what was going on...
              When the wedding was done, I don't know what to do besides coding, talking to friends, and listening to
              yorushika. But my world just ended, and I had to start anew. It was fun experiencing it, after 2 years of
              admiring her, it's finally done... I don't have to think of her anymore, well sure the hurt and the
              feelings is still their, but I just want to forget it. <br><br>

If you're reading this, you might be disgusted or some sort, but i'll leave my pride alone, thank you for the being my inspiration, I was suffering from depression ever since I was a kid, but talking to you makes me feel happy... I really liked you, but I have to move on you know? I hope we can talk often. Just thank you.
